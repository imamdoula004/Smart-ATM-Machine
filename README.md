# Smart-ATM-Machine
A C++ Smart ATM Simulator that generates an interactive web-based ATM interface with English/Bangla toggle, voice commands, transaction history, analytics charts, alerts, and recommendations. Uses BST for users, linked lists for transactions, and outputs a full ATM UI as atm.html.
